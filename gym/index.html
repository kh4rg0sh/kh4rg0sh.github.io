  Quick Notes:
1. Forearm muscles are small in size and recover quickly. You can add forearm muscle training everyday or alternate days.

2. Don't do these exercises right before sessions that need heavy grips. You can do these after the sessions or on off days as a standalone session. Don't go to failure, leave 2 or 3 RIR (reps in reserve) on each set.

3. For the Pronator Teres, sit with a dumbbell on thighs and turn it facing up to facing down, and to and fro. Do about 15 to 20 reps each set, 3 sets per session. Use lightweight, something like 2.5 or 5 kg. This muscle is not meant for heavy loading, it is meant for endurance and control.

4. For the Flexor Digitorum, dead hang with only fingers. You should be able to do this for 10 seconds atleast and target to 30 to 40 seconds. Another exercise is barbell behind the back and then finger curls. Set the barbell at hip height and grip the barbell behind the back with distance shoulder width apart. Let the barbell roll down your fingertips and then curl your fingers up so that the bar rolls back up and then curl the wrist up.
