Welcome to the "Series of Secret Blog Posts". I will be using this page as the main page for branching off all the other secret links that capture all of my journals.

This is where you should be heading <a href="/secret/getting-too-rusty">to</a>, if you'd like to know a reason behind this series of blog posts.

I had applied for the role of a Software Engineer at Stripe two weeks ago. I sent my resume and waited. Today, I received a mail that said that I've been shortlisted for the selection process and the first round is a screening round. <a href="/stripe_invitation.pdf">It</a> says that, this is a coding challenge and I will be given 60 minutes to code and submit the solution. 

From what I've heard, Stripe focuses more on clean implementation rather than heavy, complex algorithms. So, my best guess is that this is going to be an implementation challenge. I'll be practising a bit for the same and I'm gonna document this before I take the test. After taking the test, I'll document my experience again in a follow-up post.

I have decided to rigorously study the entire USACO Guide for competitive programming. I'm going to document all that <a href="/competitive_programming/usaco-guide">here</a>, which is a series of public blog posts (I don't see any reason as to why I should be keeping this private).
