title: Too Rusty at Competitive Programming
math: true

Congratulations if you stumbled upon this page! This page marks the beginning of the chain of secret blogs on my website. I mean it's not really a secret since the source code is public on github. But let's see, hmmm it's quite secret to the visible browsing eye at the very least. The point of these secret pages is to publically put out information about me and my daily happenings but also hide them away in the plainsight. It's more fun in that way I suppose.

Anyway, the point of this particular post is: 

### I am getting too rusty at Competitive Programming. I need to brush up my theory and practice the standard problems.

Two questions arise.

"What happened mmukul that lead to you being rusty at competitive programming? weren't you like okayish before." 

Well, I was lazy as fuck. After I was offered an internship in August, 2024; I didn't bother to practice competitive programmign anymore. I mean I just had no reason in hindsight to do this anymore. So I quit.

"So well why now?"

Well, I'm ashamed to say this. But. I NEED TO FIND JOBS.

To be honest, I already have an offer. I interned at Goldman Sachs, Bangalore; this summer and I think they were happy with my performance. I was offered a full-time offer after my graduation in 2026. But I feel like i could be doing much better than this. This is the reason I've started to look out for more opportunities in the garden and I've come to the realisation that almost everyone has these screening rounds that they use to filter out bad candidates. And you guessed it right. These screening rounds test your coding abilities. Which means, they ask you competitive programming problems!

Hell yeah back to start, full circle let's goo!

I cannot afford being trashed out in the very first round right. I need to atleast make it to the interviews and therefore I must clear these petty little coding rounds. For that, I must improve my pathetic current state and get better.
