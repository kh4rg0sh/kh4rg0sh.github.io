## Introduction
today i decided to take a look at c++ pwn. c++ library functions are implemented and compiled in `libcstd++`. this binary is locatable on your system. on my system this could be found at
`/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcstd++.so.6` which is symbolic link to the actual binary. on my system this is a symbolic link to `libcstdc++.so.6.0.30`

the source code could be easily looked up online. i found this website 
> https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-11.4.0/libstdc++/api

choose the correct `gcc` version according to your system. mine is `11.4.0`.
