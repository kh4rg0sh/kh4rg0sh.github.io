## About Me
Hi, my name is Mmukul Khedekar. I'm currently a final year student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee and I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I love mathematics and programming and over the past few years of my programming journey, I've developed a very keen interest for algorithms, software development and low-level systems programming, and cybersecurity. 

## Math Olympiads [2017 to 2020]
I was involved with Math Olympiads during my highschool years. Here are some of my achievements from back then!

#### Third Diploma at Russian Geometry Olympiad, 2019
I received Third Diploma at the Russian Geometry Olympiad, 2019 held in Moscow in the Grade 8 Division for solving 6 out of 8 problems.

#### Gold at IGO 2019
I stood first in the country and seventh worldwide at <a href="https://igo-official.com/?lang=en">IGO 2019</a> in the Intermediate Division.

#### IMOTC 2020
I qualified <a href="https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/mathematical-olympiad/inmo/">INMO 2020</a> (`Indian National Mathematics Olympiad`) stood among the top 35 participants and was eligible for the <a href="https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/List-of-students-invited-to-IMOTC-2020.pdf">IMO Training Camp </a> for India's IMO Team Selection organised by HBCSE. Additionally, I was eligible to take <a href="https://www.apmo-official.org/">APMO</a> that <a href="https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/APMO-2020.pdf">year</a>. 

## IIT-JEE [2020 to 2022]
I prepared for the infamous IIT engineering entrance exams during the last two years of high school. I appeared for KVPY SX 2022 (Indian Institute of Science entrance exam), JEE Main 2022 (entrance exam for all engineering colleges in India), and JEE Advanced 2022 (engineering entrance exam for the Indian Institutes of Technology).

## College Tech Involvement [2022 to -]
I'm a member of two campus tech clubs at IIT Roorkee.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>1.</th>
        <th>InfoSecIITR</th>
        <th>A club of information security enthusiasts whose primary aim is to deepen their understanding of software, and ethical hacking!</th>

        <th><a href="https://pag.iitr.in/">https://pag.iitr.in/</a></th>
    </tr>
</table>

I was selected as a Core Member in InfoSecIITR in June, 2023 and finally promoted to the position of "Additional Technical Secretary" in May, 2025. 

## Competitive Programming [2022 to -]
I actively participated in Competitive Programming contests on platforms such as Codeforces, Codechef, Atcoder, etc. from 2022 to 2024 (After which I took a break from Competitive Programming to focus on other interests, such as Software Development and Security).

You can read more about it <a href="https://kh4rg0sh.github.io/competitive_programming">here.</a>

## Summer Analyst (Internship) at Goldman Sachs [Summer, 2025]
I was hired as at Goldman Sachs for a Software Developer Intern (Summer Analyst), 2025. During my Internship Project, I worked on constructing and optimizing Mongo Views, some API endpoints using Spring Boot Web with a good unit and integrated test coverage using JUnit5 and Mockito, and finally displaying the results of the new API endpoint onto the UI using React.js and Redux Toolkit.

During my internship, they organised a coding competition for all the interns at Bangalore and Hyderabad, where I participated and won the second prize. 

## CTFs with InfoSecIITR!
I actively played CTFs with my college team, InfoSecIITR. I would mainly handle challenges related to Cryptography and sometimes, Binary Exploitation. You can read more about my writeups <a href="https://kh4rg0sh.github.io/ctf_writeups">here.</a>

After taking a break from Competitive Programming in August, 2024. I started reading more about Stack Exploitation Techniques such as Return Oriented Programming, GOT overwrite and eventually ventured into Heap Exploitation Techniques such as Tcache Poisoning, etc. I've collected a few writeups: <a href="https://github.com/kh4rg0sh/binary-exploitation-2024">Binary Exploitation 2024</a>.
