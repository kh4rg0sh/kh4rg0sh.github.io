I'm honestly so disappointed with my performance on this contest. I had 7 problems to solve and I got deadstuck on the 5th one and it took all my stamina and energy that I had no ideas on 6th and 7th problem whatsoever. In the first four problems I made errors while submitting on the 3rd and the 4th problem. I'm gonna quickly write up my thoughts and solutions to the problems that I could do and make sure I upsolve the later problems today itself!
