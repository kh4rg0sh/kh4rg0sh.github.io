I participated in this contest. this was held during some very unusual timings and it was a 3 hour contest. I believe this was because the contest was based on some Italian Olympiad that took place live. I'm really unsatisfied with my performance on this contest. And I've decided to spend more time thinking about the problems on the contest. I really want to improve and I think my main issue is that I really get hard stuck on a problem. It's like I fail to find new out of the box approaches or even make unique observations about the problem that help the chain of logic building. I really need to work on this
