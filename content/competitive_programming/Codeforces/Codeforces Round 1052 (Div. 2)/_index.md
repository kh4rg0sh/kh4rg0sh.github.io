I participated in this Contest and I managed to solve till D1. That was quite an average performance in my opinion and I still didn't manage to do problems till D1 fast without any inaccuracies. For me to retain back my original form, I should have atleast had the capacity to do till D2 or E. Anyway, I'll try to write out my thoughts and upsolve the problems.
