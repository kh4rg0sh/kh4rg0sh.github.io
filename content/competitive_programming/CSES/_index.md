CSES is another online judge that has a great collection of popular competitive programming tasks. I had been doing CSES for the past 3 years until I took a break last year. Ever since, I feel like I'm quite rusty and I don't really remember much. So I've decided to start learning everything from scratch. I've made a new account on CSES (username: `kh4rg0sh`) and I'm going to solve and submit all the problems again.
