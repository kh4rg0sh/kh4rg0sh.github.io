today while doing this problem: https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h3749391

i discovered something called beatty sequences. i havent heard about these at all before. but they seem something very interesting and daunting.

i need to read a lot about what is this all about. ofcourse the goto resource for starting down the rabbit hole is the wikipedia. you can read about beatty sequences here:

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatty_sequence

so the thing with these sequences is that, we pick an irrational number and the sequence of integers that are obtained by computing the floor of positive integral multiples of these irrational numbers are called the beatty sequences.

rayleigh's theorem states that, the complement of a beatty sequence => the sequence of positive integers that are not in this sequence is also a beatty sequence. its a beatty sequence generated by a different irrational number.

which means that the sequence of positive integers can be partitioned into B(r) and B(s), where s = r / (r - 1) and they generate complementary beatty sequences.

i realised the proof for beatty sequence using collisions and anti-collisions is kinda similar to what i did on the izho problem solve lol. i rediscovered this idea of proving through a problem. this says a lot about how nice the problem was.

there is even a criteria to determine if a number belongs to the beatty sequence B(r). if 1 - 1 / r < frac{m / r} then m belongs to beatty sequence B(r).

it has some relation with sturmian sequences (idk what they are)

there's something called lambek-moser theorem. seems interesting
also uspensky's theorem: there is no equivalent of rayleighs theorem for three or more beatty sequences. also very interesting

now im gonna go ahead and put +"beatty" in the search and gather problems that use beatty's theorem

then i also found some arxiv paper relating primes and beatty sequence: https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1015
talks about long's conjecture
i dont even see the relevance of shit in that paper but still im curious how do beatty sequences even appear in that mess
