    For this year’s Backdoor CTF, I proposed two challenges. Both of these challenges were based on Lattice attacks (as that is the area I am currently working on for my lab based project on post-quantum cryptography). The challenges and their writeups are uploaded on Github Gist. 400: Invalid request 400:...

    Introduction motivated by this blog: https://ptr-yudai.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/07/01/143652 i’ll be attempting to do something similar. at the time of writing this doc, it’s already the mid of october. there’s not even 3 months left for this year to end. the goal of this challenge would be to upsolve all the pwn challenges...

    I participated in BRICS+ CTF Quals 2024 yesterday. One of the challenges was about ELF golfing, and I found it quite interesting. For those who aren’t familiar with what this business is all about, here’s a quick introduction. The idea of Code Golf Code golfing refers to minimizing the size...

    Today I’ll be discussing a really useful implementation heavy technique that leads to a bit by bit leakage of information of variables when provided some extra information. The best way to demonstrate this is through examples so let’s get started XORSA [PlaidCTF 2021] This is a typical RSA challenge that...

    InfosecIITR hosted the annual CTF, “Backdoor CTF,” which ran for an impressive 48 hours, starting from the 16th of December to the 18th of December. This was the first time I participated as a CTF organizer and a problem setter. Also, it was a huge event this time, with approximately...

    Let’s try to motivate this parabola! Let $d_1 , d_2$ be two abitrary lines that are not perpendicular. Let $A,B$ be abitrary points lie on $d_1,d_2$. How to construct a parabola that is tangent to $d_1,d_2$ at $A,B$. I was working on this construction because it is impossible to construct...
