  <p>I’m currently a final year student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee and I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I love mathematics and programming and over the past few years of my programming journey, I’ve developed a very keen interest for algorithms, software development and low-level systems programming, and cybersecurity.</p>

## IIT-JEE [2020 to 2022]
I prepared for the infamous IIT engineering entrance exams during the last two years of high school. I appeared for KVPY SX 2022 (Indian Institute of Science entrance exam), JEE Main 2022 (entrance exam for all engineering colleges in India), and JEE Advanced 2022 (engineering entrance exam for the Indian Institutes of Technology).

## College Tech Involvement [2022 to -]
I'm a member of two campus tech clubs at IIT Roorkee.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>1.</th>
        <th>InfoSecIITR</th>

I was selected as a Core Member in InfoSecIITR in June, 2023 and finally promoted to the position of "Additional Technical Secretary" in May, 2025. 

## Competitive Programming [2022 to -]
I actively participated in Competitive Programming contests on platforms such as Codeforces, Codechef, Atcoder, etc. from 2022 to 2024 (After which I took a break from Competitive Programming to focus on other interests, such as Software Development and Security).

You can read more about it <a href="https://kh4rg0sh.github.io/competitive_programming">here.</a>

## CTFs with InfoSecIITR!
I actively played CTFs with my college team, InfoSecIITR. I would mainly handle challenges related to Cryptography and sometimes, Binary Exploitation. You can read more about my writeups <a href="https://kh4rg0sh.github.io/ctf_writeups">here.</a>

After taking a break from Competitive Programming in August, 2024. I started reading more about Stack Exploitation Techniques such as Return Oriented Programming, GOT overwrite and eventually ventured into Heap Exploitation Techniques such as Tcache Poisoning, etc. I've collected a few writeups: <a href="https://github.com/kh4rg0sh/binary-exploitation-2024">Binary Exploitation 2024</a>. 

## Summer Analyst (Internship) at Goldman Sachs [Summer, 2025]
I was hired as at Goldman Sachs for a Software Developer Intern (Summer Analyst), 2025. During my Internship Project, I worked on constructing and optimizing Mongo Views, some API endpoints using Spring Boot Web with a good unit and integrated test coverage using JUnit5 and Mockito, and finally displaying the results of the new API endpoint onto the UI using React.js and Redux Toolkit.

During my internship, they organised a coding competition for all the interns at Bangalore and Hyderabad, where I participated and won the second prize.
