For this year's Backdoor CTF, I proposed two challenges. Both of these challenges were based on Lattice attacks (as that is the area I am currently working on for my lab based project on post-quantum cryptography). The challenges and their writeups are uploaded on <a href="https://gist.github.com/kh4rg0sh/e377ee63eecfa7060c72e887429fb510" target="_blank">Github Gist</a>.
